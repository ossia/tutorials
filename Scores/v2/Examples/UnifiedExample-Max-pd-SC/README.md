This .score works for the three platforms, as follows :

- launch score, open the max-pd-sc_unified_fm-example.score
- open the fm-example (.maxpat, .pd or .scd) for your favourite platform (you may need to install ossia-max/pd/sc first, see ossia.github.io) 
- (SuperCollider Only) evaluate the main code region to start up the server and the OSCQuery device
- for Max and Pd, no need to activate audio, score will do it itself remotely
- press 'play' in score
- enjoy
